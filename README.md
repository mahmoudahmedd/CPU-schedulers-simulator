# CPU-schedulers-simulator
A java program to simulate schedulers such as non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)... etc.

Scheduling is a fundamental operating-system function. Almost all computer resources are
scheduled before use. The CPU is, of course, one of the primary computer resources. Thus,
its scheduling is central to operating-system design. CPU scheduling determines which
processes run when there are multiple run-able processes. CPU scheduling is important
because it can have a big effect on resource utilization and the overall performance of the
system.
